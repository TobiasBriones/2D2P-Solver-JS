            Repsymo is applied mathematical software aiming to solve
            domain-specific models with granular representation standards.
        </p>

        <p>
            The current version is implementing several deterministic dynamic
            programming models to solve many real-world problems in operations
            research.

        <p>
            Even though the app is still in its initial
            MVP (Minimum Viable Project) versions, some representations, like
            the solutions tree, are already <b>state-of-the-art</b>.

            The early MVP versions of the app were also intended to improve the
            teaching of operations research and make experimental studies of
            math solvers, CAS, and arbitrarily complex systems.
            This was to get the solver at a production level as a long-term
            project.
